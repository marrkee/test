# Mountain landscape

### Context

You enter the Geneva area and you see the beautiful mountains for the first time. You argue with your friend about how much mountain you can see in the landscape.

### Problem

You are given a list of `N` mountains in a 2D landscape, represented as triangles.

The `N` mountains are defined by:
- The x position of their bottom-left corner (`left ∈ ℕ`)
- The x position of their bottom-right corner (`right ∈ ℕ, right > left`)
- Their height (`height ∈ ℕ`)

The first element in the list `mountains[0]` represents the mountain which is the nearest from the observer (you). The last element `mountains[N-1]` represents the mountain behind all the others.

### Constraints

The constraints below are to be taken into account when implementing your solution. 

**Your solution will only be tested with inputs that satisfy all of the constraints below:**

- **For simplicity, the basis of any mountain is equal to two times its height:** `right - left = 2 * height`. This also implies that all mountains have the same slope (45°)
- There are `N ∈ [0, 1000]` mountains in total
- For each mountain:
  - `left, right, height ∈ ℕ`
  - `0 <= left < right < 10^5`
  - `1 <= height <= 5 * 10^4`

### Deliverable

Your job is to implement a function that takes a list of mountains as defined above and returns the visible area of mountains from the observer point of view:

```python
def visible_area(mountains: list) -> float
```

This function should be contained in a python file named `solution.py`

**Example**

![mountains](./doc/mountains.png "Mountains")

The mountains list corresponding to the landscape above is defined like this:

```python3
# Example input:
mountains = [
    {'left': 9, 'right': 15, 'height': 3},
    {'left': 8, 'right': 14, 'height': 3},
    {'left': 5, 'right':  9, 'height': 2},
    {'left': 0, 'right':  6, 'height': 3},
    {'left': 2, 'right': 12, 'height': 5},
    {'left': 5, 'right': 13, 'height': 4},
]
```

Your function will be called like this

```python3
# Testing:
area = visible_area(mountains)
print(area) # Should print 39.25 (area corresponding to the mountains given above)
```

### Ranking

Your code will be evaluated on the following points (from most important to least important):
- Correctness of the program
- Performance efficiency
- Clarity and architecture of the code
- Code style (PEP8)

You are not allowed to use libraries other than libraries from the Python Standard Library and your code should be compatible with python3.6
