# Code challenges

## Challenges

There are three independent challenges:
- [HTML form generator (JavaScript)](./javascript/)
- [Mountain landscape (Python)](./python/)
- [IRC-like application (SQL)](./sql/)

Instructions to complete each individual challenges are available in each of the sub directories. 

## Deliverables

Once you have completed all the challenges, run the `build-deliverables.sh` script to build the `solution.zip` archive.

If for some reason you cannot run this script, please make an archive that contains the content from all 3 directories (./javascript, ./python, ./sql) and name this archive `solution.zip`.

Then, send us your archive following the instructions we gave you by email.
